# Clustering

**Dataset-**
Rice (Cammeo and Osmancik)

## Overview

In this project, I have conducted clustering analysis on the well-known Iris dataset. The primary goal was to explore and compare various clustering algorithms, implement diverse pre-processing techniques, and evaluate the results using different metrics. The clustering methods employed include:

1. **K-Means Clustering ('kmeans')**
2. **Affinity Propagation ('ap')**
3. **Mean Shift Clustering ('meanshift')**
4. **Spectral Clustering ('sc')**
5. **Agglomerative Clustering ('hclust')**
6. **Density-Based Spatial Clustering ('dbscan')**
7. **OPTICS Clustering ('optics')**

## Evaluation Parameters

The performance of each clustering algorithm was assessed using three common evaluation parameters:

1. **Silhouette Score**
2. **Calinski-Harabasz Index**
3. **Davies-Bouldin Index**

These metrics provide insights into the quality and characteristics of the obtained clusters.

## Pre-processing Techniques

To enhance the clustering performance, I applied various pre-processing techniques, including:

1. **Normalization**
2. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**
3. **Transformation**
4. **Scaling**

These techniques help in handling different aspects of the data, such as scaling features, reducing dimensionality, and enhancing algorithm convergence.

## Implementation

The entire project was implemented using Python, and the code is available in the respective directories for each clustering algorithm. Each directory contains a detailed explanation of the algorithm, its implementation, and the associated pre-processing steps.
